    <p>I am Lesedi Mokou, a man who aspires to be the best at what he does.
      Most importantly loves what he does.
      I started my eduction back a long time ago approcimately in 1999, Informal
      eduction started sometime in 1993 since infants learn a lot of things as well.
      And till this date I am still learning as much as I can about everything
      that I am learning. I matriculated (grade 12) in 2011, studied at Wordsworth
      High school. Next I went to Reanert College where I studied Mathematics and Physics and Chemistry
      further which is where I fell in love with Mathematics. After that I took
      a cap year due to financial constraints,  so this is when I dicided to go work.
      The very same year I registered at unisa to study Applied
      Mathematics and Conputer Science. The very next year I took on another
      challenge which was to study Theology.

      <p>
        With regards to my computer science career
        To continue learning more programming languages to
        master these two first. I believe that once I master at least C++ other
        languages will be a easier to learn. However, the lungauges that I have worked on
        so far are C++ and Java Script. and webeditting tools such as HTML and CSS.
        I am still planning on learning more langagues.
        </p>
      <p>
        A more lighter aspect about myself is with regards to my relations
        to people. I meet my wife at the end of 2016 where we became friends.
        We  enjoyed each others company and the very next year(2017) we decided
        to date. we then decided to go for counselling, marital counselling.
        It was not to get married but to get to know each other better which was
        somewhat quicker then just getting to know each other.
        And through this process we started considering to get married. long
        story short we got married in 30 June 2017. We also have a beautiful,
        adventuras and curious son together.
